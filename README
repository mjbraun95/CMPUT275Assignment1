Wiring Instructions:
    For Adafruit ILI9341 Breakout:
        Board Pin <---> Arduino Pin
        ===========================
        GND             GND
        Vin             5V
        3Vo             NOT CONNECTED
        CLK             52
        MISO            50
        MOSI            51
        CS              10
        D/C             9
        RST             NOT CONNECTED
        Lite            NOT CONNECTED
        Y+              A2 (analog pin)
        X+              4  (digital pin)
        X-              A3 (analog pin)
        IM0 - IM3       NOT CONNECTED (they expect a 3.3v signal, DON'T CONNECT!)
        CCS             6
        CD              NOT CONNECTED

    For Joystick:
        Board Pin <---> Arduino Pin
        ===========================
        GND             GND
        5V              5V
        VRX             A1
        VRy             A0
        SW              2
    
Running Instructions:
    1. Open terminal within this directory
    2. Type the following commands:
        $ make clean
        $ make upload
    3. Use the joystick to navigate through the map
    4. Press the touchscreen buttons on the side to set the minimum rating threshold for the list of restaurants, as well as the method of sorting used
    5. Press the touchscreen map to view nearby restaurants on the map
    6. Press the joystick button to switch list the nearest 30 restaurants
    7. From there, you can use the joystick to navigate through the restaurants, and press the joystick button again to move the cursor to that restaurant 	location

Notes:
    When trying to select a restaurant from the list, you need to pull the joystick and then release it so the highlighted text would go up/down.
    We were given help from the lecture code made in class.
    Some of the restaurants in the same location will have their orders within the list switched around, due to the way we calculated our manhattan distances.
