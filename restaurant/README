Included Files:
    * get_restaurant.cpp
    * README
    * Makefile

Wiring Instructions:
    Provided for us
    
Running Instructions:
    1. Open terminal within this directory
    2. Type the following commands:
        make clean
        make upload
    3. Use the touchscreen to control the buttons
    
Assumptions:
    My screen is wired in the opposite direction as most others.

Notes:
    I was given help from the lecture code made in class.
    
    The file "get_restaurant.cpp" contains 5 functions: setup, getRestaurant, getRestaurantFast, processTouchScreen, and main:

        setup initializes the Arduino, as well as the Adafruit display with the user interface of buttons + text.
        
        getRestaurant reads all restaurants from the SD card, and dereferences a pointer to each one. This function was provided to us.
        
        getRestaurantFast does the same thing as getRestaurant, but only reads the next block of the SD card data once all the restaurants stored within the block have been read.

        processTouchScreen reads the touchscreen input from the user, calculates the location pressed on the touchscreen, checks if it is on a button, and executes the correct restaurant reader to display new time of the selected reader. Part of this function was provided to us.
        
        main is used to initialize some low level C++ commands, as well as iterate processTouchScreen repeatedly in an infinite loop.
